    <p> Welcome to my site! I am a 2018 Michigan State Univerity graduate with a degree in Hospitality Business. Originally from Michigan, I moved to Texas in 2018 to stay close to family. While I miss the snow sometimes, I change my mind as soon as it starts getting even a little bit cold here. I'm weak, what can I say? I do like Dallas, but I don't know if I'll ever be a true Texan because I can't see myself buying cowboy boots anytime soon.</p>
    <p> When I am not working, I probably spend too much time watching tv and movies but it all pays off if pop culture questions are asked during trivia. It's usually my only contribution... I enjoy cooking, baking, and art. I like to read, play video games, and explore new hobbies whenever I can. One of my favortie things is bubble tea and I am probably 25% made up of boba at this point. </p>
